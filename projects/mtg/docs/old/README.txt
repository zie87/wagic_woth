Wagic The Homebrew ?! ver 0.4.0  by WilLoW
=====================================

THIS GAME IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, IT HAS BUGS

This game lets you play card games against an AI on your PSP,
you build a deck with your initial collection, and win credits to buy new cards each time you beat your opponent.

=====================================
DONATIONWARE
=====================================
Wagic is free and open source, in the hope that it will bring more people to contribute to the project with code, cards, graphics, sounds, etc...
If you feel you have no artistic or coding skill, you can still help this project by donating money at http://wololo.net/wagic.
Thanks in advance for your support!

=====================================
INSTALL
=====================================
copy the "psp" folder at the root of you PSP.
You should end up with a folder "wth" in your GAME directory.
"wth" should contain an EBOOT.PBP file and a "Res" subdirectoy, containing a bunch of stuff

A  3.xx or HIGHER CUSTOM FIRMWARE is NECESSARY to play this game

=====================================
HOW TO PLAY
=====================================
Please read the manual to see how to play


=====================================
CAN I ADD NEW CARDS ?
=====================================
Yes, you can find information about that on my blog at http://wololo.net/wagic
A fair amount of cards can be added to the game without any programming skills.
If you're motivated enough, have a look at _cards.dat, or even better, at the source code.


=====================================
WHERE ARE THE CARD PICTURES ?
=====================================
New releases of Wagic do not include copyright infringing material, but you can of course still use your own pictures to replace the default "text" version.
card pictures have to be in the following format:

200x285 jpeg for "big" pictures
45x64 jpeg for thumbnails
pictures must be in the Set subdirectory of the card they represent, and their name is the id of the card they represent.
for example, if a card named "air elemental", in the Set directory "RV" has the following id:1189, then you'll need a 200x285 jpeg file named "1189.jpg" in the Res/Sets/RV directory, and a 45x64 jpeg file named "1189.jpg" in the Res/Sets/RV/thumbnails directory.

Pictures representing tokens have the following naming convention: id of the card that created them folloewd by a "t". 
For example, if a card name "the hive" has the ability to create tokens and the id 1138, token pictures generated by this card have to be named "1138t.jpg", and respect the same size conventions as the other cards. 

Google or the wagic forum will help you if you have problems finding/installing card pictures.
