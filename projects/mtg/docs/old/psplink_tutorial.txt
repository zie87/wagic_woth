How to debug using PSPLink + GDB on Windows

Setup 
------

1) copy the /pspsdk/psplink/psp/oe/psplink/ folder to your psp unit into PSP/GAME/PSPLINK/
2) get yourself a HEN installed so that PSPLINK will run - I personally downgraded to 6.20 & installed the TN-HEN.
3) get & install the latest libusb drivers (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/libusb-win32-releases/),
I'm using currently v1.2.2.  Note: DON'T use the ones that are in the drivers subfolder in the pspsdk package, as
they're old and definitely don't work with newer OS version (ie Win7).
4) (specific to wagic debugging) make sure that a copy of wagic.prx and wagic.elf are copied into your
wagic's /bin/ folder!

Connecting
----------

1) Open up a command window, and type 'cd <path_to_wagic's_bin_folder>' to change your current root location.
2) Type usbhostfs_pc <enter>, you should get the following:

D:\dev\wagic\projects\mtg\bin>usbhostfs_pc
USBHostFS (c) TyRaNiD 2k6
Built Mar 26 2009 16:26:00 - $Revision: 2368 $
sh>

3) type pwd <enter>, and confirm that the system points to your /bin/ folder, ie:

sh> pwd
/cygdrive/d/dev/wagic/projects/mtg/bin
sh>

4) On your PSP, launch your HEN (if you haven't already), and launch the PSPLINK util (3.0 OE version). Tether your psp via USB
to your computer if you haven't already done so.  You should see the command window indicate 'Connected to device';
if it doesn't, check your usb lib driver installation.

5) Open a second command window, and run the command 'pspsh'.  You should see it prompt you with 'host0:/> in your
new window; in the other command window, it'll show something like 'Accepting async connection (x) from 127.0.0.1'.
This window is your psp control window, for lack of a better term.  If you run 'ls', you should see it list all the files
local to your wagic's /bin/ folder. 

At this point, you can run your local drive's copy of wagic simply by running './wagic.prx' in this window; 
in our case, since we're starting a debug session, simply run 'debug ./wagic.prx'.  You'll get something like this:

host0:/> debug ./wagic.prx
PSPLink USB GDBServer (c) 2k7 TyRaNiD
host0:/> Loaded host0:/wagic.prx - UID 0x0489641B, Entry 0x088040AC

Debugging
---------

6a) debugging with GDB, console style...  (I personally recommend using an IDE as described in 6b), but your choice)


Open a third console window - this one will be used to run GDB for debugging.  In this console window, run:
'cd <path_to_wagic's_bin_folder>'
psp-gdb wagic.elf    (yes, note that we call out the elf file here, not the prx.)

You should now be prompted with a (gdb) prompt.  Now run the following to start a remote debug session:

(gdb) target remote :10001

This should prompt another 'Accepting async connection (1) from 127.0.0.1 in the usbhostfs_pc window.

You're now ready to start debugging.  Type 'c' or 'continue' to start the execution of the program.


6b) debugging with an IDE
There might be other IDEs that support GDB, but this is the only one that I managed to get working in short order. (Eclipse was too problematic, although I hear others have made it work.)

- Download & install Code::Blocks for your platform.

Follow the following tutorial on how to set up Code::Blocks to debug with the psp toolkit.

*Note:  line 12 of the debugging section has a typo - the port should be 10001, not 1001.
